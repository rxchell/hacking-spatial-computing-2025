Assessing Reaction Time using AppleVisionPro

# Assesses Reaction Time
In this challenge, the goal is to build an application that assesses reaction time
Potential Technologies: 
- Hand tracking
- Object manipulation
- World tracking / User position
- Windows, Immersive Spaces

# Research Summary
**Purpose**
To provide clinical support for a reaction-time-based app designed to help elderly users monitor cognitive health through simple daily exercises.

**Research-Based Evidence**
1. Reaction Time as a Cognitive Health Indicator
2. Reaction Time Training Has Functional Benefits
3. Similar Gamified Interventions Show Promise

**Research Finding -> Relevance to our App**
1. Slower and more variable reaction times predict cognitive decline
   -> Supports using Reaction Time as a daily monitoring metric
2. Reaction Time training improves independence and reduces fall risk
   -> Justifies a gamified, light-touch exercise 
3. Gamified/reactive VR games enhance attentional and cognitive skills
   -> Validates game format like our bubble reaction app
